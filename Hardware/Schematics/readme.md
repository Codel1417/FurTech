The schematics were designed in [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) and use a consistent Resistor/Capacitor/LED size of 0603/1608 for ease of hand soldering. The AutoRouter plugin was used for data and low current traces. JST connectors are used to connect each board together.

Why split the boards? I was concerned about limited space inside the head so smaller boards let me contour the shape of the fursuit to reduce cable lengths and reduce the need to upscale the head. Smaller boards also allows for cheaper at con component swap out if something breaks.
